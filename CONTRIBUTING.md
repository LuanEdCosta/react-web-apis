## How to contribute with code

:point_down: Basically you have to do the steps below: :point_down:

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch from the `master` branch to work on!
- Make the changes you want in the code.
- Run the `dev` script from the package.json.
- Open the browser at `http://localhost:1234` and you will see the website running.
- Run tests using the `test` script.
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the `master` branch from the original.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

**And last but not least:** Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
